## Collaborating

Just to help with readability, I encourage everyone to use this convention for commit messages (although not enforced)
https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
