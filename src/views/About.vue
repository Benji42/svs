      About Us
    </h1>
    <p>
      <brand-name-short />  is a Discord-based music-making competition that began in the spring of 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our objective  is  to  unite  the  rich  variety  of  online  music  communities  that  have  been  growing  on  Discord  through  the  simple shared goal of making music. By the end of the festival, each  server  that  participates has purely collaborative work showcasing the skills and creativity of all the musicians who  contributed  their  time  and  effort.  Their  work  is  then  played for all participants in a live Twitch festival at the end of  the  event. These streams, and more streams that take place within the competition, act as a charity fundraiser event as well.
